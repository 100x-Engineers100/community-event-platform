**Goal: Make this page the single source of truth for all 100x community-led events.**

1\. Top Nav (Header)

### **Current**

Left: `100x Community Events`  
Right CTA: `Become a Host`

### **Change**

* Keep **100x Community Events** as-is

* Change button text from **Become a Host** → **Host a community event**

## **2\. Hero Section (Big text on left)**

### **Current Headline**

`100x`  
`Engineers`  
`Events.`

### **Replace with**

`100x Community Events`

### **Current Subtext**

Where high-performance engineers meet to share, build, and break things. Join the inner circle.

### **Replace with**

Everything happening in the 100x community, in one place.  
Workshops, talks, jam sessions, and peer-led events by 100x alumni and members.

## **3\. Hero CTAs (Buttons)**

### **Current**

Primary: `Explore Events`  
Secondary: `Host an Event`

### **Change to**

Primary button:

`See what’s happening`

Secondary button:

Imp: Primary button should visually dominate. This trains the habit of checking here first.

### **Current**

`1 Total Events`  
`500+ Engineers`

### **Change copy only (not logic)**

`Community events listed`

`Discover the Energy.`

### **Replace with**

`What’s happening in the 100x community`

## **6\. Filters Row (Upcoming / Past / Online / Offline)**

### **Microcopy addition above filters**

Add a one-line helper text:

All community-led events show up here once approved.

(Small, muted text. Trust signal only)

## **7\. Event Cards**

### **Add line under event title (small text)**

Hosted by a 100x community member

## **8\. Bottom CTA Section (Currently “Ready to Spark Something?”)**

### **Current**

`Ready to Spark Something?`

Quote underneath about engineers and building.

### **Replace entire section with:**
